# EDA-of-Irish-weather

In an exploratory data analysis of Irish weather, data is pre-processed, summarised, manipulated, extracted and finally, the required results are displayed in graphs to understand the analysis easily. 
This analysis could be useful for airports to understand the passenger trend varying according to weather, as well as help them to increase profit by forecasting the operational cost, labor cost, and miscellaneous expenses according to the passenger trend varying according to the weather conditions.

The project was done in Python, Jupyter Notebook (Python 3, ipykernel)
